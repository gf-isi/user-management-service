## Usage

Environment variables for database config must be present. To set them, you can use something like in the `run-example.sh` script.

The CLI application accepts the following arguments:

- instance: to define in which instance the admin user should be created in
- language: to define the default language of the admin user.

```sh
./run.sh --instace <INSTANCE_ID> --language <preferredLanguage>
```
